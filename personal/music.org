hurts so bad
you've lost that loving feeling
baby I love you
see you in september
surfer girl
you belong to me
what can make me feel this way
my guy
I hear a symphony
on the roof
calendar girl
dancing in the streets
baby love
will you love me tomorrow
runaround sue
please mr postman
it's in his kiss
dawn (go away)
send you all my love in a letter sealed with a kill
goin' out of my head
  Paul Anka
age of aquarius
to everything turn, turn
if you're going to San Francisco
on a warm san francisco night
in a godda na vida
up on cripple creek
what the world needs now
abraham martin & John
hey mr tamborine man
summer breeze
everybody's talkin'
good morning starshine
green tamborine
black magic woman
somebody to love
incense and pepperment
let's live for today
we are stardust
take another piece of my heart now baby
eve of destruction
crimson and clover
hurdy gurdy man
nights in white satin 
white rabbit
spirit in the sky
candles in the rain
hair
let the sunshine in
beat of a different drum

teenager in love
stand by me
walk like a man
i will follow him
this magic moment
walking in the rain
locomotion
be my baby
rescue me 
I'll send you all my love (sealed with a kiss)
hurts so bad
lovin' feeling
baby, I love you
you belong to me
my girl
calendar girl
doo ron ron
chapel of love
what becomes of the broken hearted
there goes my baby
rag doll
you can't hurry love
