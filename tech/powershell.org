1) Remember that just about everything is an object, with one or more attributes and methods. Even strings are objects, and can use methods such as ".equals(System.obj)". Get-Member is your friend for determining what methods and attributes apply:
        "This is a string" | get-member

2) All (properly made) commands take the form of [verb]-[noun]:
        get-member
        set-ADUser
        remove-item
        get-help

3) When iterating over a group using "foreach" or "where-object", the special variable $_ is used as a placeholder for the current element:
        @("arrayIndex1", "arrayIndex2") | foreach { write-host $_ }
        @("RedFish", "BlueFish", "BlueBird") | where-object {$_ -like "blue*"}

4) When in doubt, use one of the following:
        Get-Help [command]
        Get-Command
        $variable | get-member
        $variable | format-list *
